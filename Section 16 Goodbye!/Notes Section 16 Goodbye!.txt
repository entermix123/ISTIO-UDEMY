The features Istio provides are huge benefits to a cluster.
	- Traffic Management
	- Circuit brakers
	- Mutual TLS
	- Fault Injection

If we want to implement them manually we have to make massive invasive changes to our applications code. 

Istio has pros and cons. Some of the tradeoffs we can mention are:
	- Misconfiguration - difficult to diagnose
	- Complexity - another huge and complex layer over the already complex Kubernetes nature
