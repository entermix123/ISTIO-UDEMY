4. What to do if you need to install Kubernetes locally?
========================================================

We can install Istio on any Kubernetes cluster eather it is running with minikube or Kind or Kubeadm or other. The file we will use is called '2-istio-minikube.yaml'.



5. (Optional) Choosing between Docker Desktop and Minikube
==========================================================

Minikube has complex installation.

To go along with the course we need to install 
	1. Docker Desktop - the most easy way to create a local Kubernetes cluster.
		- https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

	2. Kubectl - prodcution standard command line interface (CLI) that manage Kubernetes resources.
		- https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl




6. (Optional) How to Install Docker Desktop
===========================================

Register, download and install Docker Desktop - https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

If we have a problem with Docker Desktop Installation we should enable Windows features:
	- Virtual Machine Platform
	- Windows Subsystem for Linux




7. (Optional) How to Run Kubernetes in Docker Desktop
=====================================================

We need to install 'kubectl' on our OS.

Kubectl - prodcution standard command line interface (CLI) that manage Kubernetes resources.
	- https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl

Check if we have kiubectl installed
	terminal --> kubectl version

	# result:
	Client Version: v1.34.0		# this is the result we are looking for (newer version is possible)
	Kustomize Version: v5.7.1


Start Kubernetes in Docker Desktop/Kubernetes
	- Create Kubernetes Cluster
		- Cluster Type: 
			Kubeadm
			Create a single-node cluster with kubeadm.
			Version: v1.34.1
		- Create Cluster
		
	- Wait until the cluster is installed and running


If we have used kubectk with another cluster we need to switch kubectil context to Kubernetes cluster
	terminal --> kubectl config use-context docker-desktop

Verify if the kubectl is working properly with the created cluster
	terminal --> kubectl version

	# result:
	Client Version: v1.34.0
	Kustomize Version: v5.7.1
	Server Version: v1.34.1

	## We should upadte kubectl version if the version between kubecl and server are more than a minor version 1.34.x


Confirm cluster connectivity:
	terminal --> kubectl cluster-info

	# result:
	Kubernetes control plane is running at https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443
	CoreDNS is running at https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
	To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

List Nodes of our cluster:
	terminal --> kubectl get nodes

	# result:
	NAME             STATUS   ROLES           AGE    VERSION
	docker-desktop   Ready    control-plane   7m1s   v1.34.1






8. Extra note for Desktop users using a Mac with Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3 etc)
===============================================================================

Extra note for Desktop users using a Mac with Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3 etc)

Please check the following option in the settings for Docker Desktop:

Under "Docker Desktop"->Settings->General->"Virtual Machine Options", ensure that "Docker VMM"  is selected (Rosetta may have been the default).

We are aware that this setting may affect the ability for the images for Kiali and Jaeger to run correctly.


We will work with Docker Desktop Kubernetes cluster.
